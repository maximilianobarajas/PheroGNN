# PheroGNN

Graph neural networks (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, PheroGNN) benchmarked on Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed, a synthetic fraud graph, and optionally Elliptic.

## Setup

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run

```
python scripts/run_experiments.py
python scripts/analyze_results.py
python scripts/generate_figures.py
```

Results land in `results/`: per-run histories, trained models, pheromone edge weights, statistical comparisons, LaTeX tables, and figures.

## Elliptic (optional)

Download the Elliptic Bitcoin dataset and place `elliptic_txs_features.csv`, `elliptic_txs_classes.csv`, `elliptic_txs_edgelist.csv` in `data/elliptic/`, then run:

```
python scripts/run_experiments.py --include-elliptic
```

## Config

Edit `configs/default.yaml` to change datasets, seeds, model hyperparameters, or pheromone settings.
